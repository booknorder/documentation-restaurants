A combo dish is a menu item that includes a combination of certain preexisting dishes from the menu, for a set price.

How to create it:

1. From the Menu setup page, **create a new dish** in the appropriate category![](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/aus-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/51004203235/original/n16XM2OuDp\_rTLAzXElT9EXEe5P5LsMAkA.jpeg?1590940914)

3. Add the **Name** and **Price** of the dish and in the **Description** box describe what is included in the deal (example: includes 3 main dishes, 3 sides, 3 drinks of your choice)
4. Define **Option Set Blacklist** (Optional) - For when you wish to exclude some option sets that are tied to certain dishes (example: If all the main dishes offered in the combo should be the same size, you would blacklist the size option for the Mains)\
