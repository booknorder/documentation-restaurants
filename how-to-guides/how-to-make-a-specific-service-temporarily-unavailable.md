If all your tables are booked, or if your delivery drivers are unavailable at a certain time, you can use this option to make a specific service (**table bookings** / **deliveries** / **pickups** / **dine-ins**) unavailable for that particular time. Here's how to do it:

1. Log in to your account at [https://admin.booknorder.co.nz](https://admin.booknorder.co.nz/)
2. Select your restaurant, then open the "**Settings"** page ![](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/aus-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/51006716244/original/Y0wq\_ViJCLo2UhTjlYn5hY6t2QzL8iiRww.png?1599306715)
3. Click on "**Opening Hours"**\
