# How to add your store link to Google business listing

A great way to increase the number of orders is to have your online store link listed on your restaurant's Google Maps business listing. This will increase your store's visibility, as this is the first thing that will pop up when people search on Google. Make sure you've claimed your business first, then follow these steps:



1. Log in to your Google Business with the appropriate login details on the following link:\
   [https://www.google.com/intl/en/business/](https://www.google.com/intl/en/business/)
2.  From the left-hand navigation bar, select the "**Info**" section\
    \

    </div>
3.  Edit the website address and add the link to your store page, which should look something like:\
    https://www.restaurant.booknorder.co.nz\
