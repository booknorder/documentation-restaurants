# Change customer bank statement reference

Whenever a customer makes an online payment, they will see that come through on their bank statement. It's a good idea to always ensure this is clearly recognizable to prevent confusion. Stripe allows you to modify the reference text that appears on your customer's bank account.

To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Login to [https://dashboard.stripe.com/](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Navigate to the "Settings" page using the left navigation bar\

```
If you are operating a multi-branch or franchised venue, you should enter your location name as part of the statement descriptor. Otherwise customers won't be able to differentiate purchases between your different locations.
