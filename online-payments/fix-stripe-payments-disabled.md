# Fix stripe payments disabled

Usually, it's due to Stripe's inability to verify your business properly

* Lack of information provided about your business
* Incorrect business information provided
* No business website or social links provided

Thankfully, this is a relatively easy problem to solve.

1. Login to your Stripe account at [https://dashboard.stripe.com/](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. On your dashboard, you should see a few notices at the top. One of them will say something similar to "Your Stripe account is against our terms and conditions". If that is the case, then your payments have been disabled, and you can proceed with these steps
3. Visit the following link to contact Stripe, [https://support.stripe.com/contact/email](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email)
4.  On the contact page, select your "Account" and enter the other details as shown below\

5.  Scroll down and enter the following message into the message box. A copy of this message can be found at the bottom of this article. Make sure to replace {Products} with what you sell.\

After sending that mail, Stripe will follow up with you asking for additional information to verify your business. Reply to them with the information they require and they will approve your account.

They may also ask for your credit card information in order to verify your identity.

### Copy of Stripe E-Mail

Hi there,

I've tried to register a Stripe account but it's saying that my business is against your terms and conditions. I operate a restaurant selling {Products} in New Zealand. The reason for registering is to sell food online via the Book N Order platform. What can I do to verify my business?

Thank you
