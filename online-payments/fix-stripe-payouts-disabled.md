If your Stripe payouts have been disabled, you will still be able to accept online payments. However, they will not pay out any money into your bank until your account is verified. You also risk your payments being disabled if you do not verify your account.

Enabling Stripe payouts is very simple

1. Login to your Stripe account at [https://dashboard.stripe.com/](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. At the top, you will see a notice about activating your account, follow that to go to account activation
3. You will need to complete the required information and submit your account for review

Once submitted, your account should be approved within 24 hours. Here are some helpful tips to ensure your account gets approved without issues.

* Ensure you provide your registered business address, not your trading address
* Find your business information including your company certificate at the [NZ companies register](https://companies-register.companiesoffice.govt.nz/). Your company certificate is called "Certificate of Incorporation" on the companies register
* Do not search or provide company information from non-government websites (.govt.nz)
