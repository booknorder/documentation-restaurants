What you are experiencing likely has to do with the audio blocking of webpages until they become active. In all modern web browsers such as chrome, websites cannot play audio by default unless they are active. To be active the website has to be loaded and someone must touch the page at least once.

On desktops (Windows / Mac), this is not a big problem as once the page is activated, it usually stays active until closed. However, on mobile devices such as tablets and phones, websites will likely become inactivate if you switch between applications on your device. So for example, if you are using a POS system on your tablet, changing from our orders page to the POS would render our the order page as inactive stopping the sound.

A possible solution for this is to use email notifications. For example, you can log in to your email account which is receiving notifications on your device. Then you can customize the mail notification sound in your email application. That way you will get alerts when a new order email comes thru from your mail application. This will work regardless of what application is currently open.
